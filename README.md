# ATS-Programming-Database

### Introduction
Boomerang Youth Inc is a non-profit organization that promotes positive growth and bounce back opportunities to middle and high school students across the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools district as well as the greater Orange County District. Their biggest program, Alternative to Suspension (ATS), served around 112 students from 15 schools within the two districts during the ’21-’22 academic year. This program offers students facing suspension an opportunity to re-engage and build on their strengths by connecting and growing alongside each other.

As the program grows, Boomerang Youth Inc is finding it harder to keep up with student documentation and student-staff communication. While they currently employ several methods to store data on students, it is becoming more and more complex to access information stored across multiple domains. Therefore, Boomerang Youth Inc is looking for a software solution that would address this issue.

With this project, we aim to help the organization streamline their administrative overhead by developing new software solutions that integrate into their workflow along with providing new capabilities.

This project was developed using the Agile/XP method by Elad Ohana, Gabriel Mercado, Zackary Barbari, and Khang Tran for the COMP 523 Software Engineering Lab.
